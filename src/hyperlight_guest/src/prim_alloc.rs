/// is only safe when the allocator has been set up properly. It may
/// become less safe in the future.
///
/// # Panics
/// This function will panic if memory allocation fails
///
/// This is defined in an arch-specific module because it reads and
/// writes the actual allocator state with inline assembly in order to
/// access it atomically according to the architecture memory model
/// rather than the Rust memory model: the stronger constraints of the
/// latter cannot be perfectly satisfied due to the lack of per-byte
/// atomic memcpy in the host.
