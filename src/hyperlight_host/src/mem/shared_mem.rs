/// is well-behaved; and (2) the host's behaviour is defined
/// regardless of whether or not the guest is well-behaved.
///
/// The ideal (future) flow for a guest->host message is something like
///   - Guest writes (unordered) bytes describing a work item into a buffer
///   - Guest reveals buffer via a release-store of a pointer into an
///     MMIO ring-buffer
///   - Host acquire-loads the buffer pointer from the "MMIO" ring
///     buffer
///   - Host (unordered) reads the bytes from the buffer
///   - Host performs validation of those bytes and uses them
///
/// Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to do this with defined
/// behaviour in present Rust (see
/// e.g. <https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/152>).
/// Rust does not yet have its own defined memory model, but in the
/// interim, it is widely treated as inheriting the current C/C++
/// memory models.  The most immediate problem is that regardless of
/// anything else, under those memory models \[1, p. 17-18; 2, p. 88\],
///
///   > The execution of a program contains a _data race_ if it
///   > contains two [C++23: "potentially concurrent"] conflicting
///   > actions [C23: "in different threads"], at least one of which
///   > is not atomic, and neither happens before the other [C++23: ",
///   > except for the special case for signal handlers described
///   > below"].  Any such data race results in undefined behavior.
///
/// Consequently, if a misbehaving guest fails to correctly
/// synchronize its stores with the host, the host's innocent loads
/// will trigger undefined behaviour for the entire program, including
/// the host.  Note that this also applies if the guest makes an
/// unsynchronized read of a location that the host is writing!
///
/// Despite Rust's de jure inheritance of the C memory model at the
/// present time, the compiler in many cases de facto adheres to LLVM
/// semantics, so it is worthwhile to consider what LLVM does in this
/// case as well.  According to the the LangRef \[3\] memory model,
/// loads which are involved in a race that includes at least one
/// non-atomic access (whether the load or a store) return `undef`,
/// making them roughly equivalent to reading uninitialized
/// memory. While this is much better, it is still bad.
///
/// Considering a different direction, recent C++ papers have seemed
/// to lean towards using `volatile` for similar use cases. For
/// example, in P1152R0 \[4\], JF Bastien notes that
///
///   > We’ve shown that volatile is purposely defined to denote
///   > external modifications. This happens for:
///   >   - Shared memory with untrusted code, where volatile is the
///   >     right way to avoid time-of-check time-of-use (ToCToU)
///   >     races which lead to security bugs such as \[PWN2OWN\] and
///   >     \[XENXSA155\].
///
/// Unfortunately, although this paper was adopted for C++20 (and,
/// sadly, mostly un-adopted for C++23, although that does not concern
/// us), the paper did not actually redefine volatile accesses or data
/// races to prevent volatile accesses from racing with other accesses
/// and causing undefined behaviour.  P1382R1 \[5\] would have amended
/// the wording of the data race definition to specifically exclude
/// volatile, but, unfortunately, despite receiving a
/// generally-positive reception at its first WG21 meeting more than
/// five years ago, it has not progressed.
///
/// Separately from the data race issue, there is also a concern that
/// according to the various memory models in use, there may be ways
/// in which the guest can semantically obtain uninitialized memory
/// and write it into the shared buffer, which may also result in
/// undefined behaviour on reads.  The degree to which this is a
/// concern is unclear, however, since it is unclear to what degree
/// the Rust abstract machine's conception of uninitialized memory
/// applies to the sandbox.  Returning briefly to the LLVM level,
/// rather than the Rust level, this, combined with the fact that
/// racing loads in LLVM return `undef`, as discussed above, we would
/// ideally `llvm.freeze` the result of any load out of the sandbox.
///
/// It would furthermore be ideal if we could run the flatbuffers
/// parsing code directly on the guest memory, in order to avoid
/// unnecessary copies.  That is unfortunately probably not viable at
/// the present time: because the generated flatbuffers parsing code
/// doesn't use atomic or volatile accesses, it is likely to introduce
/// double-read vulnerabilities.
///
/// In short, none of the Rust-level operations available to us do the
/// right thing, at the Rust spec level or the LLVM spec level. Our
/// major remaining options are therefore:
///   - Choose one of the options that is available to us, and accept
///     that we are doing something unsound according to the spec, but
///     hope that no reasonable compiler could possibly notice.
///   - Use inline assembly per architecture, for which we would only
///     need to worry about the _architecture_'s memory model (which
///     is far less demanding).
///
/// The leading candidate for the first option would seem to be to
/// simply use volatile accesses; there seems to be wide agreement
/// that this _should_ be a valid use case for them (even if it isn't
/// now), and projects like Linux and rust-vmm already use C11
/// `volatile` for this purpose.  It is also worth noting that because
/// we still do need to synchronize with the guest when it _is_ being
/// well-behaved, we would ideally use volatile acquire loads and
/// volatile release stores for interacting with the stack pointer in
/// the guest in this case.  Unfortunately, while those operations are
/// defined in LLVM, they are not presently exposed to Rust. While
/// atomic fences that are not associated with memory accesses
/// ([`std::sync::atomic::fence`]) might at first glance seem to help with
/// this problem, they unfortunately do not \[6\]:
///
///    > A fence ‘A’ which has (at least) Release ordering semantics,
///    > synchronizes with a fence ‘B’ with (at least) Acquire
///    > semantics, if and only if there exist operations X and Y,
///    > both operating on some atomic object ‘M’ such that A is
///    > sequenced before X, Y is sequenced before B and Y observes
///    > the change to M. This provides a happens-before dependence
///    > between A and B.
///
/// Note that the X and Y must be to an _atomic_ object.
///
/// We consequently assume that there has been a strong architectural
/// fence on a vmenter/vmexit between data being read and written.
/// This is unsafe (not guaranteed in the type system)!
